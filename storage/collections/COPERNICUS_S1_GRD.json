  "description": "The Sentinel-1 mission provides data from a dual-polarization\nC-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument.  This collection\nincludes the S1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) scenes, processed\nusing the Sentinel-1 Toolbox to generate a calibrated, ortho-corrected\nproduct. The collection is updated daily. New assets are ingested\nwithin two days after they become available.\n\nThis collection\ncontains all of the GRD scenes.  Each scene has one of 3 resolutions\n(10, 25 or 40 meters), 4 band combinations (corresponding to\nscene polarization) and 3 instrument modes.  Use of the collection\nin a mosaic context will likely require filtering down to a homogenous\nset of bands and parameters.  See [this article](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/sentinel1)\nfor details of collection use and preprocessing. Each scene contains\neither 1 or 2 out of 4 possible polarization bands, depending\non the instrument's polarization settings.  The possible combinations\nare single band VV or HH, and dual band VV+VH and HH+HV:\n\n  1. VV: single co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive\n  2. HH: single co-polarization, horizontal transmit/horizontal receive\n  3. VV + VH: dual-band cross-polarization, vertical transmit/horizontal\n  receive\n  4. HH + HV: dual-band cross-polarization, horizontal transmit/vertical\n  receive\n\nEach scene also includes an additional 'angle' band that contains\nthe approximate viewing incidence angle in degrees at every point.\nThis band is generated by interpolating the 'incidenceAngle' property\nof the 'geolocationGridPoint' gridded field provided with each asset.\n\nEach scene was pre-processed with [Sentinel-1 Toolbox](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/toolboxes/sentinel-1)\nusing the following steps:\n\n  1. Thermal noise removal\n  2. Radiometric calibration\n  3. Terrain correction using SRTM 30 or ASTER DEM for areas greater than\n     60 degrees latitude, where SRTM is not available.\nThe final terrain-corrected values are converted to decibels via log scaling\n(10*log10(x)).\n\nFor more information about these pre-processing steps, please refer to the\n[Sentinel-1 Pre-processing article](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/sentinel1).\n\nThis collection is computed on-the-fly. If you want to use the underlying\ncollection with raw power values (which is updated faster), see\nCOPERNICUS/S1_GRD_FLOAT.\n",
