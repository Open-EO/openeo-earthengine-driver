# apply
* maybe better to work on arrays than images and collections
# apply_dimension
* why is the input dimension optional in apply_dimension?
# order
* process is missing in GEE 
* maybe conversion to array?
# rearrange
* process is missing in GEE
* maybe conversion to array?
# sort
* what is expected when sorting over the whole cube if no dimension is given?
# array_contains
* process is missing in GEE
# cummax
* process is missing in GEE
# cummin
* process is missing in GEE
# cumsum
* process is missing in GEE
# cumproduct
* process is missing in GEE
# power
* process needs transformation between array and image collection
* process could be done by mapping the image collection
# sqrt
* process needs transformation between array and image collection
* process could be done by mapping the image collection
# floor
* process needs transformation between array and image collection
* process could be done by mapping the image collection
# ceil
* process needs transformation between array and image collection
* process could be done by mapping the image collection
# int
* process needs transformation between array and image collection

# round
* process needs transformation between array and image collection
* process could be done by mapping the image collection
# trigonometric functions
* processes need transformation between array and image collection
* process could be done by mapping the image collection
* ar...h functions are missing in GEE
* arctan2 needs 2 arrays, i.e. it is not a simple apply
