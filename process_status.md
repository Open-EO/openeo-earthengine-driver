# openEO v0.4.0 process status
## General TODOs:
- Mapping from an array to an image collection (preserve metadata) (important for e.g. sort)
- Introduce Numbers for simple processes
- Properly read the default values from the JSON files
- Band filtering issue of none available bands (i.e., reduce without band filtering fails)

## Arrays
- [ ] array_contains
    * process is missing in GEE
    * implementation could be somehow done like in _count_
- [ ] array_element
    * process is available (_ee.Image.arrayGet(position)_), but not feasible to implement at the moment (position needs to be an image, ...).
- [ ] count 
    * could be theoretically implemented with existing processes:
        * _ee.ImageCollection.count()_ or _sum()_ as a reducer (mask needed)
        * _ee.Image.updateMask(mask)_ 
- [ ] order
    * process is missing in GEE 
    * maybe conversion to array?
