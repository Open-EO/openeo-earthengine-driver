The data cube is expected to have only one dimension of type `bands`.\n\nThe following criteria can be used to select bands:\n\n* `bands`: band name (e.g. `B01` or `B8A`)\n\n**Important:** The order of the specified array defines the order of the bands in the data cube, which can be important for subsequent processes. If multiple bands are matched by a single criterion (e.g. a range of wavelengths), they are ordered alphabetically by band names. Bands without names have an arbitrary order.",
