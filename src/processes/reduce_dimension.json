    "description": "Applies a unary reducer to a data cube dimension by collapsing all the pixel values along the specified dimension into an output value computed by the reducer. This process passes a list of values to the reducer. In contrast, ``reduce_dimension_binary()`` passes two values, which may be better suited especially for UDFs in case the number of values gets too large to be processed at once.\n\nThe dimension is dropped. To avoid this, use ``apply_dimension()`` instead.",
