  "description": "The data cubes have to be compatible. A merge operation without overlap should be reversible with (a set of) filter operations for each of the two cubes. An overlapping dimension has the same name, type, reference system and resolution in both dimensions, but can have different labels. One of the dimensions can have different labels, for all other dimensions the labels must be equal. If data overlaps, a OverlapResolverMissing exception is thrown, since the parameter `overlap_resolver` is not available at this backend.",
