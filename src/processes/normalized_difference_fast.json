    "description": "Computes the normalized difference for two bands. The normalized difference is computed as *(band1 - band2) / (band1 + band2)*.\n\nThe process returns a raster data cube with exactly one band that holds the computed values. The newly created band is named `normalized_difference` by default. This name can be changed with the `name` parameter.\n\nThis process could be used for a number of remote sensing indices such as:\n\n* [NDVI](https://eos.com/ndvi/)\n* [NDWI](https://eos.com/ndwi/)\n* [NDSI](https://eos.com/ndsi/)\n\nPlease note that some back-ends may have native processes available for convenience such as the ``ndvi()``.\n\n**Important: This is a new process to evaluate a faster alternative to the standardized process ``normalized_difference()``. Use ``normalized_difference()`` for interoperability and this process for fast processing.",
